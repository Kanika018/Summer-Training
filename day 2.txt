question 7:- Study/Read about Vulture and Firefly?
solutions- About vulture :
Indeed, the binary file is a zip file that contains a directory.
In the directory there is a binary called vulture. Consequently, you can cd into the directory and starts vulture from there
by the command ./vulture.
In short, I'll assume you run on ubuntu just open a terminal and type...
$ cd Download
$ tar -xvzf vulture_1.2.1-vulture_linux_amd64.tar.gz
$ cd vulture_1.2.1-vulture_linux_amd64
$ ./vulture
Note - that it is important that you starts vulture from where the binary is because the html/css/js files to create the we
interface are in the static directory next to it.
Solution How to install firefly ?
Install firefly from source using:
pip install firefly-python              How to use?          Create a simple python function.
# fib.py
def fib(n):
	if n == 0 or n == 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) 
And run it using firefly.
$ firefly fib.fib
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
...
That started the fib function as a service listening at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Let us see how to use it with a client.

>>> import firefly
>>> client = firefly.Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000/")
>>> client.fib(n=10)
89
The service can also be invoked by sending a POST request.

$ curl -d '{"n": 10}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/fib
89
